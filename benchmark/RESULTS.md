# LegacyMind benchmark results

Generated 2026-07-17T15:34:28.731Z by `node benchmark/run-benchmark.mjs`.

Every module below was parsed to IR, migrated to Java 21 by the
transpiler (two prompt-variant candidates, replayed from the committed
cache), and verified **against the real GnuCOBOL 3.1.2 binary running
sandboxed in Docker** — no mocks anywhere in this table. CERTIFIED
means layer B plus every other run layer (A, C, D) passed on the
selected candidate; every disclosed gap is listed in the certificate.
Each certificate is Ed25519-signed and re-verified against the trusted
key in the same run — the **Signed** column is that check, so a
tampered or wrongly-signed certificate would fail the benchmark.

## Parser coverage against an external corpus

Corpus: https://github.com/uwol/proleap-cobol-parser (commit d1bfe75bdd6d), 759 files.

| Engine | Tier | Files | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| stub | parsed | 0 | 0.0% |
| proleap | front-end accepted (grammar + preprocessor) | 737 | 97.1% |
| proleap | IR-complete (every construct lowered) | 15 | 2.0% |

Front-end acceptance is what the production grammar and its
reference-format preprocessor handle; IR-complete is the stricter
tier the rest of the pipeline consumes today. Files in between
parse fine but use constructs the IR lowering does not model yet —
every one is enumerated per file, never skipped silently, and the
histogram below is the prioritized lowering backlog.

| Construct outside the IR subset | Occurrences |
|---|---|
| REDEFINES view "…" is numeric-edited, not elementary unsigned numeric DISPLAY (REDEFINES R1a) | 3218 |
| MOVE target "…" is subscripted but not a lowered table (O3 backlog) | 2607 |
| CLOSE of "…" which is not a lowered file | 951 |
| REDEFINES group view "…" over elementary target "…" (RG aligns group leaves to group leaves) | 911 |
| OPEN of "…" which is not a lowered file | 878 |
| WRITE with ADVANCING/END-OF-PAGE/INVALID KEY (outside file I/O stage 1) | 766 |
| GO TO FAIL-ROUTINE-WRITE inside PERFORM-reachable paragraph FAIL-ROUTINE is neither a structured ran | 750 |
| USAGE COMP (binary - unmeasured semantics, outside the verified subset) | 720 |
| READ of "…" which is not a lowered file | 551 |
| SELECT PRINT-FILE ASSIGN TO a non-literal (XXXXX055) | 397 |
| FD PRINT-FILE without a matching LINE SEQUENTIAL SELECT | 397 |
| GO TO BAIL-OUT-WRITE inside PERFORM-reachable paragraph BAIL-OUT is neither a structured range early | 375 |
| GO TO CLOSE-FILES is a backward or self jump; only strictly forward top-level jumps are supported | 368 |
| SET target(s) TO a value other than TRUE (only SET condition-name TO TRUE or SET index TO n is suppo | 331 |
| PERFORM target "…" is not a paragraph in this program | 306 |

## Reproduction

```
cd legacymind
npm --prefix cli install && npm --prefix cli run build
node benchmark/run-benchmark.mjs            # requires Docker
node benchmark/parse-sweep.mjs <corpus-dir> # optional external sweep
```

Candidates replay from `transpiler/cache/` (committed), so the run is
offline and deterministic; layer A seeds are fixed and recorded in each
report. Certificates and layer reports land in `out/bench/<module>/`.
